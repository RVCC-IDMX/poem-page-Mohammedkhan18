    <div class="stanza">
        <p>At midnight, in the month of June, <p>I stand beneath the mystic moon.</p>
        <p>An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,</p>
        <p>Exhales from out her golden rim,</p>
        <p>And, softly dripping, drop by drop,</p>
        <p>Upon the quiet mountain top,</p>
        <p>Steals drowsily and musically</p>
        <p>Into the universal valley.</p>
        <p>The rosemary nods upon the grave;</p>
        <p>The lily lolls upon the wave;</p>
        <p>Wrapping the fog about its breast,</p>
        <p>The ruin molders into rest;</p>
        <p>Looking like Lethe, see! the lake</p>
        <p>A conscious slumber seems to take,</p>
        <p>And would not, for the world, awake.</p>
        <p>All Beauty sleeps!, and lo! where lies</p>
        <p>Irene, with her Destinies!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>O, lady bright! can it be right,</p>
        <p>This window open to the night?</p>
        <p>The wanton airs, from the tree-top,</p>
        <p>Laughingly through the lattice drop,</p>
        <p>The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,</p>
        <p>Flit through thy chamber in and out,</p>
        <p>And wave the curtain canopy</p>
        <p>So fitfully, so fearfully,</p>
        <p>Above the closed and fringed lid</p>
        <p>'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,</p>
        <p>That, o'er the floor and down the wall,</p>
        <p>Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!</p>
        <p>Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?</p>
        <p>Why and what art thou dreaming here?</p>
        <p>Sure thou art come O'er far-off seas,</p>
        <p>A wonder to these garden trees!</p>
        <p>Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress,</p>
        <p>Strange, above all, thy length of tress,</p>
        <p>And this all solemn silentness!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,</p>
        <p>Which is enduring, so be deep!</p>
        <p>Heaven have her in its sacred keep!</p>
        <p>This chamber changed for one more holy,</p>
        <p>This bed for one more melancholy,</p>
        <p>I pray to God that she may lie</p>
        <p>For ever with unopened eye,</p>
        <p>While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep</p>
        <p>As it is lasting, so be deep!</p>
        <p>Soft may the worms about her creep!</p>
        <p>Far in the forest, dim and old,</p>
        <p>For her may some tall vault unfold,</p>
        <p>Some vault that oft has flung its black</p>
        <p>And winged panels fluttering back,</p>
        <p>Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,</p>
        <p>Of her grand family funerals,</p>
        <p>Some sepulchre, remote, alone,</p>
        <p>Against whose portal she hath thrown,</p>
        <p>In childhood, many an idle stone,</p>
        <p>Some tomb from out whose sounding door</p>
        <p>She ne'er shall force an echo more,</p>
        <p>Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!</p>
        <p>It was the dead who groaned within.</p>
